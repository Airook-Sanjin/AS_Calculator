I ended up forking the repo from our group project so I could make my own customizations without messing with the main group version. It was a good way to experiment and add some personal touches, like tweaking the layout and adding a few extra features. Forking gave me the freedom to play around with the code and make it my own, which was a lot of fun. Overall, it was a great way to get some hands-on practice with front-end development!
