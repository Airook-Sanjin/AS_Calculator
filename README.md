It’s a simple calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s got all the basic functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, plus some extra features like square roots, percentages, and squaring numbers. The original design is clean and straightforward, with a gray and black theme that makes it easy to use.

I ended up forking the repo from our group project so I could make my own customizations without messing with the main group version. It was a good way to experiment and add some personal touches, like tweaking the layout and adding a few extra features. Forking gave me the freedom to play around with the code and make it my own, which was a lot of fun. Overall, it was a great way to get some hands-on practice with front-end development!
